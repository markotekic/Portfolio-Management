    "Variance is used to describe the spread of data points within the data set; how far values in the data set deviate from the mean (average). The larger the variance the larger the spread and variability of observations from the mean. When used in the context of investing, variance describes volatility of an asset; the larger the variance the more volatility the asset has. Because investment returns **generally** follow a normal distribution, this variability can be measured with variance, which shows the probability of each deviation from the mean. Mean is the average return, or **expected return**, for a particular asset.\n",

    "To eliminate negative values variance is expressed as the square of the original data set units, which makes variance difficult to interpret. To get to a more meaningful number, we use the square root of the variance or standard deviation (SD). SD is expressed in the same units as the data set. Relevant unit of measurement for standard deviation is the same as the unit of measurement for share returns, a percentage (%). Interpretation for a security with SD of 10% is that it has a 10% variation of returns from its mean over the observed period.\n",
